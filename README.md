# Vim “Elrond” Colorscheme

Color scheme for [Vim](http://www.vim.org) (and
[NeoVim](http://neovim.org)!) based upon the built-in `elflord` color
scheme, with added extras for 256 color terminals, and a matching theme
for Airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/). For both themes
a reasonable fallbacks for 16 color terminals are provided.
